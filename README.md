# ASN-Mapper
This **ASN Mapper** is a fast and user-friendly recon tool designed for ethical hackers. It maps a domain or ASN to its subdomains, IP ranges, live hosts, and open ports using tools like `subfinder`, `masscan`, and `nmap`. Ideal for surface mapping in bug bounty and red team engagements.
